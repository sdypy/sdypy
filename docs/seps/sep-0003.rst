Abstract
--------
SDyPy uses Python's namespace package mechanism to include packages whith a
high level of integration into its namespace while alowing for an independently
developement processes. The use of namespace packages in SDyPy is described in
this document.

Motivation
----------
As SDyPy aims to integrate multiple open-source Python packages in the
structural dynamics field to provide a coherent workflow, it may be beneficial
to include some packages into the SDyPy namespace. However, it is reasonable
that some of these packages keep a high level of independence in their
develpment and distribution (e.g. their repositories with a wealth of existing
resources, issues and commit hitories...). To achieve this, Python's namespace
package mechanism is used.

Detailed description
--------------------
The four levels of integration, described in `SEP1 <./sep-0001.rst>`_, define
two types of packages that are included in the SDyPy namespace, but are
developed in independent repositories:

- **2nd level** packages are namespace packages with a high level of integration with SDyPy, that are developed by a separate organization.
- **1st level** packages are hosted by the `SDyPy organization`_, but can be developed in a repository, separate from the `core SDyPy pacakge`_.

To integrate these two types of packages into the SDyPy namespace, Python's
`namespace package`_ mechanism is used.
A native support for namespace packages has been introduced with Python 3.3 and
is defined by `PEP 420`_. When a package has reached a high level of integration
with SDyPy, it can be included into the SDyPy namespace by adhering to Python's
namespace package file structure ::

   example_project/
      setup.py
      SDyPy/
         example_project/
            __init__.py

As stated in Python's `namespace package documentation`_, it is important
that the namespace directory (`SDyPy/`) omits an `__init__.py` file.
It is also necessary to alter an existing package's setup script to adhere to
the changed file structure.

When a package, developed by a separate organisation is defined to be part of
the SDyPy namespace, as shown in the above example, it becomes a Level 2
SDyPy package. If it's ownership is also transfered to the
SDyPy organization it becomes a Level 1 SDyPy package.
